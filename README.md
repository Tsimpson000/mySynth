# MySynth Plugin

MySynth is an FM synthesizer audio plugin developed using the JUCE framework. It allows users to create and manipulate various sounds using oscillators, envelopes, filters, and modulation parameters.

## Features

- **Oscillator:** Supports sine, saw, and square waveforms with adjustable frequency and depth for frequency modulation (FM).
- **ADSR Envelope:** Adjustable Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release parameters for shaping the amplitude envelope of the sound.
- **Filter:** Includes low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters with adjustable cutoff frequency and resonance.
- **Filter ADSR Envelope:** Independent Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release parameters for the filter envelope.
- **MIDI Support:** Accepts MIDI input for note triggering and modulation control.
- **Parameter Automation:** All parameters are controllable via the plugin interface and can be automated within a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
- **Customizable GUI:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with separate sections for oscillator settings, ADSR envelopes, and filter controls.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE with JUCE installed.
3. Build the project to generate the plugin binary.
4. Locate the compiled plugin file (`.vst`, `.vst3`, or `.au`) in the build output directory.

## Usage

### Using the Plugin

1. **Host Integration:** Load the plugin in any compatible DAW or audio host application.
2. **Interface Overview:**
   - **Oscillator Section:** Choose waveform type (sine, saw, square), adjust frequency modulation (FM) depth and frequency.
   - **ADSR Envelope Section:** Set Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release times for amplitude modulation.
   - **Filter Section:** Select filter type (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass), adjust cutoff frequency and resonance.
   - **Filter ADSR Section:** Adjust Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release times for filter modulation.
3. **MIDI Control:** Use MIDI keyboard or MIDI input to trigger notes and control modulation parameters.

### Developer Notes

- **Project Structure:** The project consists of `PluginProcessor.cpp/h`, `PluginEditor.cpp/h`, `SynthVoice.cpp/h`, and `SynthSound.h`.
- **Parameter Handling:** Parameters are managed using `AudioProcessorValueTreeState` for seamless integration with DAW automation.
- **Synthesis Logic:** Synthesis logic is encapsulated in `SynthVoice`, handling note triggering, envelope processing, and rendering audio.
- **Filtering:** Filter processing is implemented with support for ADSR envelope modulation.
- **Graphics:** GUI components (`PluginEditor`) are customized to provide intuitive controls for oscillator, ADSR, and filter parameters.
